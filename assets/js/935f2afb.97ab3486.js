The network was trained on historical data data from NASA\u2019s ASO missions, divided into regions, and then a LightGradientBoost Model was used to preform recursive feature elimination to produce an efficient feature selection and region-specific model. The class contains the required functions for downloading data, pre-processing, running inference, and for producing visualizations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/DataAccess/dataAccess":{"id":"products/DataAccess/dataAccess","title":"Data Access","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/HydroServer/hydroServer":{"id":"products/HydroServer/hydroServer","title":"HydroServer","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/NextGen Framework/NGIAB":{"id":"products/NextGen Framework/NGIAB","title":"NextGen In A Box","description":"NextGen National Water Resources Modeling Framework Community Release","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/NextGen Framework/NWM-intro":{"id":"products/NextGen Framework/NWM-intro","title":"What is National Water Model (NWM)?","description":"The National Water Model (NWM) is a hydrologic model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to simulate and forecast water conditions across the United States.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/products-intro":{"id":"products/products-intro","title":"CIROH Products","description":"CIROH scientists and engineers work to improve the understanding of hydrologic processes, operational hydrologic forecasting techniques and workflows, community water modeling, translation of forecasts to actionable products, and use of water predictions in decision making.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/RTI-Eval/RTIEval":{"id":"products/RTI-Eval/RTIEval","title":"RTI Eval","description":"TEEHR - Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/StreamFlow Eval/StreamflowEval":{"id":"products/StreamFlow Eval/StreamflowEval","title":"Streamflow Eval Tool","description":"Streamflow Evaluator Tool (SET) is a Python-based, user friendly, fast, and model agnostic streamflow evaluator tool.

It allows a user to evaluate the performance of a hydrological model at the collocated USGS gauges and NHDPlus stream reaches. This Python-based tool helps visualize the results and investigate the model performance interactively. The current version of the tool is available on GitHub and can be accessed using the following link.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/Tethys Portal/Tethys":{"id":"products/Tethys Portal/Tethys","title":"NWM Research Apps Portal","description":"Comprised of a large technologically and topically diverse group of scientists, CIROH and NOAA NWM researchers require a means to organize, catalog, coordinate, and share research data products, tools, visualizations, and interactive software applications in an accessible, consistent, and intuitive manner. This project aims to address this need by building and seeding a web-based catalog of interactive web applications, notebooks, software tools, and learning modules that demonstrate and provide access to NWM modeling advances, datasets, visualizations, and information synthesis innovations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"products/Water Node/WaterNode":{"id":"products/Water Node/WaterNode","title":"Welcome to the Water Node","description":"What is the Water Node?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"services/2i2c-intro":{"id":"services/2i2c-intro","title":"CIROH-UA 2i2c Portal","description":"CIROH-UA\'s 2i2c JupyterHub details","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
