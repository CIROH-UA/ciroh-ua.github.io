NextGen is a cutting-edge hydrologic modeling framework that aims to advance the science and practice of hydrology and water resources management. In this month\'s blog, we will highlight some of the recent achievements and developments of the Community NextGen team.\\n\\nFirst, we are excited to announce that NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) is now available with Singularity support. This means that you can run NGIAB on any HPC system that does not support Docker, using Singularity containers. Singularity is a popular tool for creating and running portable and reproducible computational environments. To learn how to use NGIAB with Singularity, please visit our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/CIROH-UA/Ngen-Singularity](https://www.nextgen.com/company/newsroom).\\n\\nSecond, we have made several improvements and enhancements to NGIAB, such as updating the sample input data, upgrading the Boost library, adding auto mode run, and supporting geopackage format. You can find more details about these updates on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra](https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2024/01/23/nextgen-tv-is-coming-and-heres-what-you-need-to-know/).\\n\\nThird, we would like to share with you is the development of NextGen Datastream, a tool that automates the process of collecting and formatting input data for NextGen, orchestrating the NextGen run through NextGen In a Box (NGIAB), and handling outputs. The NextGen Datastream is a shell script that orchestrates each step in the process, using a configuration file that specifies the data sources, parameters, and options for the NextGen run. The NextGen Datastream can also generate its own internal configs and modify the configuration file as needed. You can find more details and instructions on how to use the NextGen Datastream on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/README.md).\\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this blog and found it informative and useful. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to contact us at ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu. Thank you for your interest and support in the Community NextGen project. Stay tuned for more exciting news and developments in the next month. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n[Visit NGIAB News](/docs/products/tools/nextgeninabox/news)"},{"id":"NextGen Updates Dec 2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/NextGen Updates Dec 2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-30-NextGen-Update-Monthly.md","title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - December 2023","description":"News and release notes for NextGen","date":"2023-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"nextgen","permalink":"/blog/tags/nextgen"}],"readingTime":0.185,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4"},{"name":"Zach Wills","url":"https://github.com/orgs/CIROH-UA/people/ZacharyWills","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60660437?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60660437?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - December 2023","description":"News and release notes for NextGen","slug":"NextGen Updates Dec 2023","authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4"},{"name":"Zach Wills","url":"https://github.com/orgs/CIROH-UA/people/ZacharyWills","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60660437?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60660437?v=4"}],"tags":["nextgen"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - January 2024","permalink":"/blog/NextGen Updates Jan 2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"NextGen In A Box v1.1.0 Release","permalink":"/blog/NextGen In A Box Release Notes"}},"content":"Happy New Year!!!
